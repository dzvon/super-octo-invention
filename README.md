We always find interesting things and some great learning materials. It's not
fun to be happy alone, so I created this repository to share some
interesting things that I have found myself.

WTF is the name of this repository? Itâ€™s always a headache to come up with a
name, so I just use the random name generated by GitHub.


- [Firewalling with OpenBSD's PF packet filter](https://home.nuug.no/~peter/pf/en/index.html)

  to figure out a concept that could have been explained in 3 minutes. This made
  me realize how important it is to have an easy-to-understand reading materials.
