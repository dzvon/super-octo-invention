We always find interesting things and some great learning materials. It's not
fun to be happy alone, so I created this repository to share some
interesting things that I have found myself.

WTF is the name of this repository? Itâ€™s always a headache to come up with a
name, so I just use the random name generated by GitHub.


- [Firewalling with OpenBSD's PF packet filter](https://home.nuug.no/~peter/pf/en/index.html)
- [Daryl's TCP/IP Primer](https://www.ipprimer.com) - I still remember the time
  I spent 3 months in my college library struggling with those stereotypical
  books just trying to understand the concept of a "layer". Three months, just
  to figure out a concept that could have been explained in 3 minutes. This made
  me realize how important it is to have an easy-to-understand reading materials.
- [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) - This site
  might be familiar to many of you, but I want to share it anyway, because it
  was how I got started with computer science. We are always asked if we can use
  a tool, but we are rarely asked if we understand what's going on under the
  hood. It's unfortunate.
